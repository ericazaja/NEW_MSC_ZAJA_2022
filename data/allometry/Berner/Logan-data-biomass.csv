"Appendix for Berner et al., Biomass allometry for alder, dwarf birch, and willow in boreal and tundra ecosystems of far northeastern Siberia and north-central Alaska",,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
Description,,,,,,,,,,,,
Physical characteristics of 358 shrubs sampled mid to late summer in 2011-2013 from 33 sites spread between northern Alaska and far northeastern Siberia (Yakutia).,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We sampled a variety of species including Alaskan green alder (A. viridis subsp. crispa), Siberian alder (A. fruticosa), dwarf birch (Betula  nana subsp. exilis and B. nana subsp. divaricata) and a variety of willow (e.g., S. alaxensis, S. glauca, and S. pulchra, and others).",,,,,,,,,,,,
"Measurements include shrub basal diameter (BD), height (H), and stem length (L), as well as stem, branch, new growth (NG; new twigs and leaves), and total aboveground biomass (AGB).",,,,,,,,,,,,
Please contact the noted data contributor for more information or if you wish to use these data in further analyses or publications.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,
