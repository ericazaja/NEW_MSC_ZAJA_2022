# WARMING PROJECTIONS: Novel growth with warming scenario

#  Get biomass over full time period. Divide biomass by 6 deg warming (difference between KP and CG temps). Get biomass per degree of warming
# multiply this by the 5 degrees projected warming.
# NB we basically gave the KP shrubs in the CG the warming that they will experience naturally in the future.
