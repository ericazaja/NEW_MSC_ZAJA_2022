# WARMING PROJECTIONS: Average natural growth with warming scenario

# STEP 1. Height with warming: 
# Height over time S. pulchra on QHI: 0.1 cm per year. = 2.4 cm height over 24 years (1999-2022, 24 years) . 
# STEP 2. Cover over time. Multiply by full time period.
# STEP 3. BIOMASS: Put the height over the full time period and the cover over full time period in the allometric equations, derive biomass. 

# STEP 4 Get temp over time slope: times the slope per year times 24 years => 1.2 degrees C over 24 years. 
# Divide the biomass over the full time period by the temp over the full time period 1.2 = to get 2.0 g/m2 per degree
# THEN Multiply the 2.0 g/m2 per degree x 5 degrees warming (future proj. Difference between temp in 2020-2100)  = 10cm
