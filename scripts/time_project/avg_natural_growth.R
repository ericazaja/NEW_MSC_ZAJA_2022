# TIME PROJECTIONS: Average natural growth scenario
#  Mean amount of growth, what has been happening on average 
# in real world (~baseline)

# Data: 
# 1. Height data: QHI monitoring 1999 -2022. Height over time → slope (cm per year). 
# 2. Cover data: ITEX QHI, TOOLIK, ANWR. Cover over time → slope (% cover per year). 
# Put these two SLOPES into the allometric equations to obtain biomass

# Multiply the obtained biomass by 80 years and add to existing 2022 biomass
