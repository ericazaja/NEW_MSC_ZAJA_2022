# TIME PROJECTIONS: Novel growth scenario
# We brought shrubs from the boreal forest into the common garden 
# and gave them 9 years to grow. How much do they grow? 
# NB only using southern shrubs because based on our common garden study 
# we assume that the northern shrubs have weird phenology because of photoperiod 
# adaptation so we won’t consider their growth rates.

# Height: height over time 
# Cover: cover over time
# → get biomass
